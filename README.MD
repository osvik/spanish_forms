This is an **example template** to build petition pages in the Spanish office. We wanted a flexible design, where we could **customize everything** without the restrictions imposed by other templates.

With this templates we can **host** the petition pages anywhere, including [secured.greenpeace.org](https://secured.greenpeace.org), [www.greenpeace.org](http://www.greenpeace.org) or micro sites with it's own domain or server.

The template was developed to send data to **Engaging Networks**, but it can be easily adapted to send data to Silverpop or other custom made scripts.

And of course it has to work well in **mobile phones**, tablets and desktop computers.

## Design / Development

- **Responsive** design with responsive images.
- Form validator that allows **complex validation rules** and that can be customized trough the html code.
- Uses **bootstrap** a widely used CSS/JS library.
- **Cookie law** compliant.
- Works well enough with JavaScript off.
- Works well enough with CSS off.

## Social networks

- Both **open graph** and **Twitter cards** are enabled.
- Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus **social media buttons** in the thank you page.

## SEO

- Html is structured for SEO, with **headers** and **meta information**

## Mods

Users can add an hash to the end of the URL and modify the page behavior. At the moment two hash mods have been implemented:

- **\#notel** - Makes the phone number not required.
- **\#notrack** - Does not track in Google Analytics or the database.

## Google Analytics and marketing

- Records all **Google Analytics campaign parameters in the database**. Alternatively we can use any other parameter we want.
- Uses a GA event to track conversions, so we can use **multiple thank you pages** or AB test between this and other templates.
- GA Events are also used to track error messages on the form and improve usability.
- Tracking for clicks in buttons and links.
- **Yandex Metrica** enabled.
- **Google remarketing** enabled.

## Tests

- Unit tests to **help webbies check for html errors**. Uncomment the html at the end of the page to enable unit testing.

## Dynamic info on page

- **Number of signups** can be added to the page either in between text or as a designed counter.
- **To be developed** next - Number of tweets to page
- **To be developed next**  - Number of FB Likes
- **To be developed next**  - Last signups
