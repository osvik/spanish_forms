- **(1)** - I did test the form with a Firefox 3.6 (2010) on a Mac and it worked. The only logo didn't show because Modernizr didn't work. Firefox 12 was launched in 2012.
- **(2)** - In the thank you page the social media buttons don't have icons (no svg support). The user will be able to understand the buttons because of it's labels and colors. The lack of icons can be fixed by replacing vectorials with png's when Modernizr.svg == false
